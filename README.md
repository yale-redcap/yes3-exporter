# YES3 Exporter README

Version 1.0.7, March 2024

The YES3 Exporter complements REDCap's reports and data export tool by adding functionality to support integration with statistical software and datamarts, including host file system exports.

Major features include flexible layouts (horizontal, vertical, repeating events/forms), good performance on very large exports, and export-specific data dictionaries that can be packaged with data exports.  Other helpful built-in features include detailed audit reports, metadata and data distributions within the data dictionary, and the ability to roll back export specifications.
